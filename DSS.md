## Notes
- I could potentially merge all DSS facing information into one large JSON file for easy modification to products, partners, etc...


## Changes needed for
- ContactButton in Home does not look good, i like the call to action but Im not sure about a button like that


## Good idea for quote submission
Have a quote submitter slide out from the right so that the user can go back and look at stuff


## Mobile specifications
Built to be functional and reactive for devices with a screen-width of at least 480 pixels


## Timeline ideas
- Highlighted events should slightly grow, icon should turn black and grow slightly as well
- Just make the line one long thing and the middle section can be only the icon
